# octosurf
source code cross referencer for GitHub

## motivation

I have attended [Seo Kwangyul's Haskell school][haskell_school], and open source
Haskell project contribution was its fee. I ponder which project should I select.
Programming language domain is one of Haskell strong points, and cross
reference tools such as [LXR][lxr] and [GNU GLOBAL][global] come to mind.
OctoSurf will provide a GitHub integration. Upon git push, it compiles cross
reference webpages that resemble GitHub code browsing and pushes them into
[GitHub Pages][github_pages]. I want to deepen my understanding of function
programming while growing this project.
